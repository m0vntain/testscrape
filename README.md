# Sample Web Scraper in Python

This is just a mini sample project created in Python that scrapes a list of famous mathematicians in this site (`http://www.fabpedigree.com/james/mathmen.htm`) and stores it in a text file. 


## Packages

This program uses only 2 packages, [requests](https://2.python-requests.org/en/master/) and [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/)

## How to run

You should try to execute the file `maths.py`  in a virtual environment. If you don't know how to use a virtual environment in Python, try to follow the basics found [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#venv-def)
